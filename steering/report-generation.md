# Report Generation

## Purpose

Generate dual-format assessment report matching the 5-section navigation structure:
**Overview → Assessment Summary → Routing Topology → Migration Approach → Analysis**

This is an **assessment report** — present findings and options, do not prescribe a single migration path.

## Step 1: Build Master Finding List & Calculate the Migration Difficulty Score

### 1.1 — Build the Master Finding List

Compile ALL findings from sections 1–7. Every item must appear. No item may be skipped. Each finding already carries an **Impact 1–5** (per the Impact Indicator rubric). This list is the single source of truth for the score — every point deducted MUST trace back to exactly one row here.

### 1.2 — What the score means

The **Migration Difficulty Score** is a **0–100** number that reflects the **amount of change / effort** needed to move from the **current ingress source** (NGINX, ALB Ingress, or 3rd-party) to the **chosen target** (Gateway API or ALB Ingress): **high = little change (easy)**, **low = much change (hard)**. It is an *effort index*, not a manday estimate — we cannot know who implements it — so it ranks relative effort using the per-finding Impact ratings.

Two design rules from operator feedback drive this version:

- **The score is NOT artificially capped.** A single hard item no longer locks the whole score at "very hard." Items that genuinely need redesign are surfaced **separately** via the **Re-architecture Gate** (§1.4) — an informational badge that does not overwrite the number. This lets a mostly-clean estate score well while still flagging the one route that needs a rethink.
- **Clean routes count.** Routes already on a target/maintained controller contribute **0 effort** and stay in the denominator, so "how much is already fine" is visible and pulls the score up.

### 1.3 — Map each finding to a scoring category

Every finding belongs to exactly one category. Categories are weighted by a **max deduction cap** — the cap is how much that dimension can drag down "ease of migration".

**0-effort routes (count, never deduct) — relative to the *chosen target*:** an Ingress/route already served by the **chosen target controller** is "done" — e.g. routes already on **Gateway API** when the target is Gateway API, or routes already on the **AWS Load Balancer Controller (ALB)** when the target is ALB Ingress (a maintained 3rd-party controller that already meets the goal also counts). It appears in the inventory denominator at **0 pts** and is **excluded** from the Scale/Volume work-count. **Source-relative caveat:** when the source is **ALB Ingress** and the target is **Gateway API**, ALB-Ingress routes are **migration work, not done** — score them via Migration Risk 6.4 + Routing Complexity. Do not deduct for routes that need no migration.

| Category | Max deduction | Findings that feed it (source sections) |
|----------|--------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Feature-Gap — **No Equivalent (Tier A)** | 30 | **Source features with no faithful target equivalent and no standard workaround.** NGINX source: `configuration-snippet`/`server-snippet`/Lua, ModSecurity, mirror-to-arbitrary-backend, regex rewrite with capture groups, TLS passthrough, mTLS client-cert. **ALB-Ingress→Gateway source:** external Target Group `actions.*` ownership conflict, `frontend-nlb-*` (Migration Risk 6.4). **These also raise the Re-architecture Gate.** (Ingress Resource Analysis, Traffic & Routing, Blockers) |
| Feature-Gap — **Workaround Exists (Tier B)** | 10 | Features with **no native target annotation but a well-known low-effort workaround**: **CORS** (app/middleware), **IP allowlist** (Security Group / WAF), **rate-limit** (WAF). **ALB-Ingress→Gateway source:** **WAF Classic** (`waf-acl-id`/`web-acl-id`) → migrate to WAFv2 first. Rate **Impact 2** when the feature is performance/hardening only; **Impact 3** when it is entangled with business-logic flow (multiple workstreams to coordinate). Never Impact 4–5. (Ingress Resource Analysis, Traffic & Routing) |
| Routing Complexity | 20 | Regex paths, `rewrite-target`, canary/traffic-split, header/method routing, cross-namespace fan-out (Traffic & Routing, Routing Topology) |
| TLS & Certificates | 15 | cert-manager→ACM move, SNI, multi-cert hosts (DNS & Certificates Analysis) |
| DNS Cutover & Blast Radius | 15 | New ALB endpoint + DNS repoint, external-dns Gateway-API source maturity, hostname/TTL stability (DNS & Certificates Analysis, Migration Risk) |
| Downtime / Rollback Readiness | 10 | New-LB provisioning, long-lived/stateful connections, presence of a weighted/blue-green rollback path (Migration Risk) |
| Controller Health & EOL/CVE | 10 | NGINX version EOL, active CVE exposure, controller pod health (Ingress Discovery) |
| Scale / Volume | 10 | **Count of routes that actually need work** = total routes − 0-effort routes. Do NOT scale off the raw total. (Ingress Discovery, Routing Topology) |
| Backend Compatibility | 5 | Exotic backends, `ExternalName`, service-type edge cases (Ingress Resource Analysis) |

Caps deliberately sum to 125 (over-provisioned) so a genuinely high-change estate floors toward 0 — that is intended: much change ⇒ low score.

### 1.4 — Scoring algorithm (deterministic — follow EXACTLY)

```
# Per-finding base points by Impact (reuse the rating you already assigned)
def base_points(impact):
    return {5: 10, 4: 6, 3: 4, 2: 2, 1: 1}[impact]   # Unknown (⬜) = 0 pts, but list it

# Tier-B feature impact (CORS / IP-allowlist / rate-limit):
#   Impact 2 if performance/hardening only (not in the business-logic path)
#   Impact 3 if entangled with business-logic flow (multiple workstreams)
# NEVER score a Tier-B feature above Impact 3.

# 0-effort routes (already on the CHOSEN TARGET controller):
#   list them in the inventory, contribute 0 pts, EXCLUDE from Scale/Volume count.
#   NOTE: ALB-Ingress routes are NOT 0-effort when the target is Gateway API.

score = 100
for each category:
    cat_deduction = 0
    for each finding in this category:        # 0-effort routes contribute nothing
        cat_deduction += base_points(finding.impact)
    cat_deduction = min(cat_deduction, category_cap)
    score -= cat_deduction
score = max(0, score)

# --- Re-architecture Gate (INFORMATIONAL — does NOT change the score) ---
# Count the routes/conditions that need a redesign or approval. Report this as a
# separate badge next to the score. The score already reflects their effort via the
# Tier-A / TLS / cross-namespace deductions — do NOT also cap the number.
gate = 0
gate += count(production routes using a Tier-A no-workaround feature: Lua/snippet/mirror/regex-capture)
gate += count(routes needing TLS passthrough OR mTLS client-cert with no faithful target)
gate += count(cross-namespace / shared-LB routes not expressible without ownership changes)
gate += 1 if a revenue-critical hostname cutover has no rollback path (single hostname, no weighted/blue-green)
gate += 1 if controller is EOL with an active exploitable CVE and no maintenance window
gate += 1 if EKS Auto Mode managed LB and a self-managed AWS LB Controller race for ownership
# gate == 0  -> "✓ No re-architecture blockers"
# gate  > 0  -> "⛔ N route(s)/condition(s) need redesign or approval"
```

### 1.5 — Score interpretation

| Score | Label | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| 90–100 | **TRIVIAL** | Mechanical — ALB Controller / ATX auto-converts; hours |
| 80–89 | **EASY** | Minor manual tweaks |
| 70–79 | **MODERATE** | Several features need manual mapping; plan it |
| 60–69 | **HARD** | Significant feature gaps or risky cutover |
| 0–59 | **VERY HARD** | Large amount of change across the estate |

The **Re-architecture Gate** is reported independently of the band: e.g. *"82 / EASY · ⛔ 1 route needs redesign"* is valid — the estate is mostly trivial, but one route still needs a rethink. Score answers "how much work?"; the gate answers "does anything need a redesign decision?".

### 1.6 — Build the Score Breakdown table (MANDATORY)

Before writing the headline, produce this table so the math is auditable. Sum `base_points` per category, apply the cap, order highest-deduction first. The **Total** must equal `100 − score`. Add a final **Re-architecture Gate** line stating the count and which routes (it does not change the total).

```
| Category | Findings (impact) | Raw pts | Capped | Cap |
|----------|-------------------|---------|--------|-----|
| Feature-Gap — No Equivalent (Tier A) | snippet on /checkout (5) | 10 | 10 | 30 |
| Feature-Gap — Workaround Exists (Tier B) | CORS (2), rate-limit (2), allowlist (2) | 6 | 6 | 10 |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| **Total deductions** | | | **-XX** | |
| **Re-architecture Gate** | 1 route — snippet on /checkout | — | — | — |
```

Then: `Score = 100 − (total capped deductions) = XX — [LABEL]`, plus the gate badge.

### 1.7 — Worked example (reflecting the feedback)

Estate: **18 ingresses** — **6 already on ALB** (0 effort, done), **2 annotation-only** moves, and **10 needing work**. Of the 10: `configuration-snippet` Lua on `/checkout` (Tier A, no workaround), CORS + rate-limit + IP-allowlist (Tier B, performance-only → Impact 2), `rewrite-target` on 3 routes (Routing, Impact 2 each = annotation-grade), cert-manager→ACM (TLS, Impact 3), NGINX 1.9.x EOL no active CVE (Controller, Impact 3).

```
Feature-Gap Tier A:  10  (cap 30)   # /checkout snippet  -> also Gate +1
Feature-Gap Tier B:   6  (cap 10)   # CORS+rate-limit+allowlist, Impact 2 each
Routing:              6  (cap 20)   # 3 rewrites @ Impact 2 + 2 annotation-only moves
TLS:                  4  (cap 15)   # cert-manager -> ACM
Controller:           4  (cap 10)   # nginx EOL, no CVE
Scale/Volume:         4  (cap 10)   # 10 routes need work (NOT 18) -> Impact 3
Σ = 34  ->  score = 100 − 34 = 66  (HARD)

Re-architecture Gate = 1  ->  "⛔ 1 route needs redesign (snippet on /checkout)"
```

Final: **66 / HARD · ⛔ 1 route needs redesign.** Contrast with v1, which floored the same cluster at **13 / VERY HARD** by maxing Feature-Gap on soft items and then locking the ceiling. The new model credits the 6 done + 2 easy routes, drops CORS/allowlist/rate-limit to Impact 2, counts 10 (not 18) for volume, and reports the one true blocker as a gate instead of erasing the number.

## Step 2: Consistency Checks (MANDATORY)

| Check | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| High-impact (5) item missing from Blockers table | Add it |
| Medium-impact item missing from Recommendations table | Add it |
| Executive Summary mentions wrong rating | Fix to match master list |
| Prose paragraph that should be a table | Convert to table |
| Raw YAML in findings (not Migration Approach) | Replace with summary |
| Score Breakdown total ≠ (100 − score) | Recompute — the table is the source of truth |
| CORS / IP-allowlist / rate-limit scored above Impact 3 | Re-rate: Impact 2 (perf/hardening) or 3 (business-logic-entangled) |
| Routes already on ALB / Gateway API counted as work | Set to 0 effort; exclude from Scale/Volume count |
| Scale/Volume scored off the raw total, not routes-needing-work | Recount excluding 0-effort routes |
| Re-architecture Gate count ≠ Tier-A/passthrough/ownership findings | Reconcile the gate to the master list |
| Headline `[[SCORE:nn:LABEL]]` band ≠ the §1.5 table | Fix the label to match the number |

## Step 3: Write Topology JSON

Save to `~/ingress_migration/<cluster>/topology.json`. Include nodes (EC2 instances).

## Step 4: Write Markdown Report

**Filename:** `~/ingress_migration/<cluster>/report.md`

### Content Rules (MANDATORY)

1. **Use tables for all structured data.** Never write lists of facts as prose.
2. **No ID column in any table.** Remove all "ID" columns — they add no value for the reader.
3. **No raw YAML/config in findings.** YAML belongs only in Migration Approach.
4. **Every finding cell: max 2 sentences.**
5. **No filler text.** Go straight to content.
6. **One Migration Difficulty Score (0–100), derived only from the rated findings.** It is a deterministic roll-up of the per-finding Impact ratings (see Step 1), shown once on the Overview page — not a separate prescriptive verdict. The migration-path decision still belongs to the team. Do NOT invent ad-hoc per-section sub-scores.
7. **No ASCII art diagrams.** The HTML has the 3D routing diagram.
8. **Multi-value cells in tables:** put each item on its own line using `<br>` (the renderer turns this into real line breaks). For **Current Configuration**, use nested bullet/sub-bullet lists instead of a table.
9. **Executive Summary = one-shot understanding for a non-technical reader.** Top-level bullet per impact theme, indented sub-bullets for specifics. Bold the key term in each bullet; wrap the most damaging facts in `!! !!` (renders red).
10. **Emphasis syntax (supported by the renderer):** `**bold**` for key terms, `!!red highlight!!` for high-impact / at-risk items, backticks for `versions/code`. Use sparingly — only words that carry the impact.
11. **Lead with impact.** Order Executive Summary bullets and Assessment Summary rows from highest impact to lowest.
12. **Download buttons (renderer tokens):** drop `[[DL:gateway-api]]`, `[[DL:alb]]`, `[[DL:atx]]`, or `[[DL:current]]` anywhere in the markdown — the renderer replaces each with a one-click download button for that option's combined routing config (built from the exported manifests). Prefer a download button over printing long target/current config text.
13. **In-page anchor links:** write `[blocker](#blockers)` to link to a section — the renderer auto-scopes the anchor to the cluster (e.g. `#c0-blockers`). Use this wherever the text says "see Blockers".
14. **Impact everywhere, by the rubric:** Assessment Summary, Ingress Discovery, Routing Topology, Traffic & Routing, Blockers, Recommendations, Ingress Resource Analysis, DNS & Certificates Analysis, Migration Risk all use the **Impact 1–5** scale (🟡1-2 / 🟠3-4 / 🔴5) — never GREEN/AMBER/RED. Every score MUST be justified against the **Impact Indicator** rubric (security/reputation · business/revenue · nature & effort), not ad-hoc judgement. Note: easy-to-deploy prerequisites (e.g. installing CRDs) are LOW even if they block a path.

### Report Template (follow EXACTLY)

```markdown
# EKS Ingress Migration Assessment Report

| Information | Value |
|-------------|-------|
| Cluster | [name] |
| Region | [region] |
| Kubernetes Version | [version] |
| Account ID | [account-id] |
| Assessment Date | [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] |

---

## Migration Difficulty Score

> Place this as the first authored section on the Overview page (the renderer injects the 3D Routing Diagram just above it, so the rendered flow is: cluster info → 3D diagram → this score → Executive Summary). The headline is the `[[SCORE:nn:LABEL]]` token (colored gauge, green = easy / red = hard) optionally followed by a `[[GATE:n]]` token (re-architecture badge: green ✓ when `n` is 0, red ⛔ when `n` > 0). `nn` is the 0–100 number from Step 1; `LABEL` is the band. One sentence states the bottom line, then the Score Breakdown table makes the math auditable.

[[SCORE:66:HARD]] [[GATE:1]]

[One sentence: how much change leaving NGINX needs for this cluster and the single biggest driver. State how many routes are already done (0 effort) and how many actually need work. If the gate is > 0, name the route(s) that need redesign.]

### Score Breakdown

| Category | Findings (impact) | Deduction | Cap |
|----------|-------------------|-----------|-----|
| [highest-deduction category] | [finding (impact), …] | -X pts | [cap] |
| [next] | [...] | -X pts | [cap] |
| **Total deductions** | | **-X pts** | **Score: XX% — [LABEL]** |
| **Re-architecture Gate** | [N route(s) + which, or "none"] | — | informational |

> The gate row never changes the total — it flags routes that need a redesign/approval decision. Routes already on ALB / Gateway API / a supported 3rd-party controller are listed at **0 pts** and excluded from the Scale/Volume count.

---

## Executive Summary

> Write for a non-technical / low-tech reader — one glance must answer "how risky is this and why." Lead with the biggest impact. **Bold** the key noun in each bullet; wrap the most damaging facts in `!! !!` so they render red. Split any bullet that lists multiple items into indented sub-bullets.

- **Ingress controllers:** [N] in use — !![the single biggest risk, e.g. one is End-of-Life with known CVEs]!!
  - [Controller A] `vX` (modern)
  - [Controller B] `vX` (modern)
  - [Controller C] `vX` !!(EOL / unsupported)!!
- **Biggest migration blocker:** !![the one thing most preventing a clean migration]!! — [one phrase why]
- **Conversion effort:** [N] Ingress resources — [X] convert cleanly, !![Y] need redesign!! ([features with no Gateway API equivalent])
- **Scope:** [namespaces] namespaces, [hosts] hosts, TLS [partial — X of Y]

---

## Impact Indicator

> Place this rubric **before Assessment Summary** (Overview group). EVERY Impact score in the report MUST follow it — do not invent ad-hoc severities. Impact weighs three dimensions: security/reputation, business/revenue, and nature & effort to remediate; score the dominant one. Render as a table, one row per band, each cell a bullet list.
>
> **Execution risk counts — do NOT score by YAML-edit size.** A small manifest change can still be high-impact. Specifically: changing `ingressClassName` to a *different controller* (e.g. nginx→alb) **provisions a brand-new load balancer** and only takes traffic after a **DNS cutover** (it is a parallel-run + cutover, not a no-op edit); moving a feature that has **no faithful equivalent** (CORS, rate-limit, external auth) to WAF/app usually needs **application/code changes**; and any TLS/cert-store change done together with routing changes risks **SSL handshake errors / downtime**. Score these by the operational risk, not the diff size.

| Impact | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| 🟡 1–2 Low | - **Security:** hardening gap, no business-effective breach (e.g. a secret kept in-cluster, not in a secrets manager)<br>- **Business:** no revenue loss / downtime / lost transactions<br>- **Nature:** optional "should/may-do" best practice (reliability / automation)<br>- **Effort:** hours–1 day, one person, single service or route, no impact to business flows |
| 🟠 3–4 Medium | - **Security:** breach with limited reputation / trust loss (weigh likelihood & history)<br>- **Business:** revenue loss limited to short downtime<br>- **Nature:** tech debt / weak design, hard to reverse, costly to fix later<br>- **Effort:** scoped to part / an area or one cluster — not all flows |
| 🔴 5 High | - **Security:** breach with major loss or reputational damage (weigh likelihood & history)<br>- **Business:** significant revenue loss or prolonged downtime<br>- **Nature & Effort:** needs re-design / re-architecture, maybe business or provider approval. *If large but straightforward to deploy → rate medium-to-low.* |

---

## Assessment Summary

> Rate each theme by **migration Impact 1–5**, highest first. Impact = how hard/risky it is to **transfer or replace that feature** versus the current NGINX/Ingress setup, plus the effort to change.
> Do **NOT** rate trivial "is X installed" prerequisites the customer already knows (e.g. "Gateway API CRDs not installed") — rate the **feature transfer/replacement difficulty** instead.
> Color bands: **1–2 = 🟡 low**, **3–4 = 🟠 medium**, **5 = 🔴 high**.

| Theme | Impact | Why — feature transfer / replacement effort vs. current setup |
|-------|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| [highest-impact theme] | 🔴 5 | [which feature can't transfer cleanly + replacement effort] |
| [next] | 🟠 4 | [...] |
| [next] | 🟠 3 | [...] |
| [next] | 🟡 2 | [...] |
| [lowest] | 🟡 1 | [...] |

> Rows are themes framed as "how hard to replace", e.g.: NGINX snippet/auth/mirror features → no Gateway API equivalent; controller currency (EOL vs modern); TLS/cert model (K8s Secret vs ACM); routing complexity (regex/rewrite); canary/traffic-split portability. Order strictly by Impact descending.

---

## Current Configuration

## Current Configuration

> Goal: convey the environment at a glance. Use a bullet list. For any value with multiple items (controllers, namespaces), use indented **sub-bullets** — never a comma list or a raw `<br>`.

- **Ingress controllers:**
  - [controller-a] `vX` (modern)
  - [controller-b] `vX` (modern)
  - [controller-c] `vX` !!(EOL)!!
- **Controller namespaces:**
  - [ns1]
  - [ns2]
- **Total Ingress resources:** [count]
- **Namespaces with Ingress:**
  - [ns1]
  - [ns2]
- **Routing pattern:** [host-based / path-based / both]
- **TLS enabled:** [partial — X of Y]
- **Load balancer types:** [ALB / NLB / ClusterIP]
- **Nodes:** [count] — [instance types]

---

## Ingress Discovery

| Item | Impact | Current State | Recommendation |
|------|--------|---------------|----------------|
| Ingress Controllers Installed | [🟡1-2 / 🟠3-4 / 🔴5] | [summary] | [action or "None required"] |
| IngressClass Resources | [impact] | [summary] | [action or "None required"] |
| Ingress Resource Inventory | [impact] | [summary] | [action or "None required"] |

---

## Routing Topology

> Keep this table narrow so it fits. Combine host+path into one **Route** column, backend+port into **Backend:Port**, TLS as ✓/—, and add a per-route **Impact** (1–5). Omit a shared host suffix (note it above the table). Use `<br>` for multi-backend cells.

| Ingress | NS | Controller | Route (host · path) | Backend:Port | TLS | Impact |
|---------|----|------------|---------------------|--------------|-----|--------|
| [name] | [ns] | [controller] | [host · path] | [svc:port] | [✓/—] | [impact] |

---

## Traffic & Routing

| Item | Impact | Current Config | Recommendation |
|------|--------|----------------|----------------|
| Routing Pattern Mapping | [impact] | [[DL:current]] | [action] |
| Advanced Traffic Features | [impact] | [[DL:current]] | [action] |
| Cross-Namespace Routing | [impact] | [[DL:current]] | [action] |

> **Current Config column:** use the `[[DL:current]]` download button (the current manifests are already exported) rather than printing long config strings.

---

## Migration Options

> Three migration paths. **Every option uses the same layout** (apply Option 1 as the template):
> 1. an **info panel** (blockquote): `> **What:** … · **Effort:** Low/Medium/High · **Best when:** …` then a second line `> **Routing config:** [[DL:<token>]]`
> 2. aligned **Phase 1 — Foundation / Phase 2 — Convert & Test / Phase 3 — Cutover / Phase 4 — Cleanup**, each a `| Step | Action |` table with numbered steps.
> Do NOT print verbose target config — the `[[DL:*]]` button downloads it. Where a route can't convert, link `(see [blocker](#blockers))`.
> No summary/intro blockquote above the options — send the reader straight into Option 1 so they engage with the steps.

### Option 1: Gateway API

> **What:** Kubernetes-native successor to Ingress (HTTPRoute + Gateway). · **Effort:** Medium · **Best when:** you want the long-term standard.
> **Routing config:** [[DL:gateway-api]]
> **Caveats:** L7 ALB Gateway API support is recent (HTTPRoute ≥ v2.14, GA 2026 line) — verify TLS handling and routing filters per route before cutover. On **EKS Auto Mode** running a self-managed LBC too, scope `GatewayClass`/`IngressClass` per controller to avoid !!load-balancer ownership conflicts!!. For routes already on the **ALB Ingress** controller, scan `lbc-migrate` blockers first — WAF Classic (`waf-acl-id`/`web-acl-id`), `frontend-nlb-*`, and external Target Group ownership have no clean Gateway path (see Migration Risk 6.4) — and run new ALBs **in parallel** with the old (expect !!duplicate ALB cost!! during cutover).

#### Phase 1 — Foundation
| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Install Gateway API CRDs |
| 2 | Verify/upgrade AWS LB Controller (**≥ v2.14** for L7 Gateway API; not needed on Auto Mode) |
| 3 | Create GatewayClass |
| 4 | Create Gateway per listener group |

#### Phase 2 — Convert & Test
| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Generate HTTPRoutes from current Ingress (download config above). For routes already on **ALB Ingress**, `lbc-migrate` can auto-generate them — see `gateway-api.md`. |
| 2 | Verify equivalence with the **dry-run Migration Console** before creating any ALB (`gateway.k8s.aws/dry-run` + `IngressPlanAnnotation`) |
| 3 | Apply low-risk routes first; validate routing, TLS, health (new ALBs run in parallel with the old) |
| 4 | Routes with no equivalent (snippets/auth/mirror) — redesign (see [blocker](#blockers)) |

#### Phase 3 — Cutover
| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Shift DNS to the Gateway ALB (weighted) |
| 2 | Watch 5xx / latency |
| 3 | Confirm all HTTPRoutes `Accepted=True` |

#### Phase 4 — Cleanup
| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Delete migrated Ingress resources |
| 2 | Remove old controllers |
| 3 | Remove unused IngressClasses |

> Options 2 (ALB) and 3 (ATX) follow the identical panel + Phase 1–4 structure, each with its own `[[DL:alb]]` / `[[DL:atx]]` button. Keep the ALB annotation-conversion table and the ATX "What ATX Converts" table as reference sub-sections under their options.

#### Phase 3: Traffic Cutover

| Step | Action | Validation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| 1 | Update DNS to Gateway LB | [how to verify] |
| 2 | Monitor error rates | [what to watch] |
| 3 | Confirm all routes healthy | [check command] |

#### Phase 4: Cleanup

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Delete old Ingress resources |
| 2 | Remove old controller |
| 3 | Remove unused IngressClass |

---

### Option 2: AWS Load Balancer Controller (ALB Ingress)

Stay on the Ingress API but swap NGINX annotations for ALB annotations. Gets you WAF, Cognito/OIDC, Shield integration without adopting Gateway API.

**When to choose:** Team not ready for Gateway API, needs ALB features immediately, or has many Ingress resources to convert quickly.

#### Annotation Conversion Summary

| NGINX Annotation | ALB Equivalent |
|-----------------|----------------|
| `ingressClassName: nginx` | `ingressClassName: alb` |
| `nginx...rewrite-target: /$2` | `alb...transforms.<svc>` (url-rewrite JSON) |
| `spec.tls[].secretName` | `alb...certificate-arn` or `certificate-discovery: "true"` |
| `nginx...ssl-redirect: "true"` | `alb...ssl-redirect: "443"` |
| `nginx...proxy-read-timeout` | `alb...load-balancer-attributes: idle_timeout.timeout_seconds=N` |
| `nginx...auth-url` | `alb...auth-type: oidc` + `auth-idp-oidc` JSON |
| `nginx...enable-cors` | Remove — use AWS WAF or app-level |
| `nginx...whitelist-source-range` | `alb...scheme: internal` + security groups |
| `nginx...proxy-body-size` | Remove — app-level config |

#### Migration Steps

| Step | Action | Validation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| 1 | Install AWS LB Controller **v2.7.2+** (ALB Ingress); not needed on EKS Auto Mode | `kubectl get deploy -n kube-system aws-load-balancer-controller` |
| 2 | Provision ACM certificates | `aws acm list-certificates` — all ISSUED |
| 3 | Convert annotations per mapping above | `kubectl apply --dry-run=client -f <file>` |
| 4 | Deploy migrated Ingress (new ALB created) | `kubectl get ingress -A` shows ALB address |
| 5 | DNS weighted routing: shift traffic CLB→ALB | `dig <host>` resolves to new ALB |
| 6 | Remove NGINX controller + orphaned TLS Secrets | `kubectl delete deploy -n ingress-nginx ingress-nginx-controller` |

#### Per-Ingress Conversion Table

| Ingress | Namespace | Key Changes | Complexity |
|---------|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| [name] | [ns] | [e.g., "rewrite→transforms, TLS→ACM"] | [Low/Medium/High] |

> **Manifests exported to:** `<cluster>-manifests/target/alb/`

---

### Option 3: AWS Transform (ATX) — Automated

For customers with AWS Transform access — fully automated manifest rewriting. ATX reads the included Transform Definition and converts all NGINX Ingress manifests to ALB annotations automatically.

**When to choose:** Many Ingress resources (>10), want consistent automated output, have ATX workspace access.

#### How It Works

| Step | Action | Who |
|------|--------|-----|
| 1 | Upload TD from `atx/td_ingress-nginx-lbc/transformation_definition.md` | You |
| 2 | Point ATX at your Ingress manifest repository | You |
| 3 | ATX scans, converts, validates automatically | ATX |
| 4 | Review diff and merge | You |
| 5 | Deploy + DNS cutover | You |

#### What ATX Converts

| Pattern | Before (NGINX) | After (ALB) |
|---------|----------------|-------------|
| IngressClass | `nginx` | `alb` |
| URI Rewrite | `rewrite-target` + regex | `transforms.<svc>` JSON |
| TLS | K8s Secrets | ACM `certificate-arn` |
| Auth | `auth-url` | `auth-type: oidc` |
| CORS | `enable-cors` | Removed (WAF/app) |
| Internal | `whitelist-source-range` | `scheme: internal` |

#### ATX Validation (Automatic)

- ✅ No `ingressClassName: nginx` remains
- ✅ No `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/*` annotations
- ✅ All rewrites use valid `transforms.<svc>` JSON
- ✅ All TLS ingresses have ACM + ssl-redirect + ssl-policy
- ✅ `kubectl apply --dry-run=client` passes

## Blockers

> Lives under **Migration Approach** (not Analysis). Finding name only — no "— RED" suffix. **Impact 1–5** (🟡1-2 / 🟠3-4 / 🔴5). **Action Required** is a bullet list — use `- item<br>  - sub-item` for sub-bullets. No Effort column (manday effort depends on team experience and can't be fixed reliably).

| Finding | Impact | Action Required |
|---------|--------|-----------------|
| [finding name] | [🔴 5] | - [action]<br>  - [sub-action] |

> If no high-impact items exist, write: "No blockers identified."

---

## Recommendations

> Lives under **Migration Approach**. **Impact 1–5** = how disruptive *implementing* the action is to the running app / production (🟡1-2 / 🟠3-4 / 🔴5). No Effort column.

| Finding | Action | Priority | Impact |
|---------|--------|----------|--------|
| [finding name] | [specific action] | [High/Medium/Low] | [🟡/🟠/🔴 n] |

---

## Ingress Resource Analysis

> **Impact 1–5** = severity *if left as-is* (not migrated). Usually low/medium — the app keeps running on NGINX today (🟡1-2 / 🟠3-4 / 🔴5). **Recommendation** is a bullet list (`- item<br>  - sub-item`). No Reference column.

| Item | Impact | Current State | Recommendation |
|------|--------|---------------|----------------|
| Annotation Inventory & Mapping | [impact] | [summary] | - [action]<br>  - [sub-action] |
| TLS Configuration | [impact] | [summary] | - [action] |
| Backend Service Compatibility | [impact] | [summary] | - [action] |

---

## DNS & Certificates Analysis

> Same approach as Ingress Resource Analysis: **Impact 1–5** if left as-is (usually low — DNS/TLS still serve today), bullet **Recommendation**.

| Item | Impact | Current State | Recommendation |
|------|--------|---------------|----------------|
| external-dns Gateway API Support | [impact] | [summary] | - [action] |
| cert-manager Gateway Integration | [impact] | [summary] | - [action] |
| ACM Integration | [impact] | [summary] | - [action] |

---

## Migration Risk

| Item | Impact | Current State | Recommendation |
|------|--------|---------------|----------------|
| Downtime Risk | [impact] | [summary] | - [action] |
| Feature Gap Analysis | [impact] | [summary] | - [action] |
| Rollback Readiness | [impact] | [summary] | - [action] |

**Section placement in nav:**
- **Overview:** Information table, **3D Routing Diagram** (injected by the renderer), **Migration Difficulty Score** (headline gauge + Score Breakdown), Executive Summary, Impact Indicator (rubric, just before Assessment Summary)
- **Assessment Summary:** Assessment Summary table, Current Configuration, Ingress Discovery
- **Routing Topology:** Routing Topology table, Traffic & Routing
- **Migration Approach:** Migration Options (Option 1: Gateway API, Option 2: ALB Controller, Option 3: ATX — same panel + Phase 1–4 layout), **Blockers**, **Recommendations**
- **Analysis:** Ingress Resource Analysis, DNS & Certificates Analysis, Migration Risk
- **References:** **Export Materials** (the generated manifests + download buttons, rendered by the tool), then **AWS Reference Links**

Note: There is **no Migration Planning section** (scope/complexity/timeline fold into Migration Options and Blockers) and **no Investigate Manually section**. Blockers/Recommendations live under **Migration Approach**. The former "Appendix" is **Analysis**. **Export Materials** and **AWS Reference Links** live under **References** (Export Materials first). Gateway API Readiness is folded into Migration Options, not a standalone section.

## Step 5: Generate HTML Report

After ALL cluster markdown reports are written, generate a **single combined HTML**:

```bash
# Single cluster
python3 tools/report_to_html.py \
  ~/ingress_migration/<cluster>/report.md \
  --topology ~/ingress_migration/<cluster>/topology.json \
  --manifests ~/ingress_migration/<cluster>/manifests

# Multiple clusters — one HTML with cluster dropdown
python3 tools/report_to_html.py \
  ~/ingress_migration/cluster-a/report.md ~/ingress_migration/cluster-b/report.md \
  --topology ~/ingress_migration/cluster-a/topology.json ~/ingress_migration/cluster-b/topology.json \
  --manifests ~/ingress_migration/cluster-a/manifests ~/ingress_migration/cluster-b/manifests \
  -o ~/ingress_migration/EKS-Ingress-Migration-<YYYY-MM-DD>-<HHMM>.html
```

Do NOT generate HTML manually. Always use the script.

## Step 6: Export Materials

> **Directory contract (required by `report_to_html.py`):** lay manifests out as `current/`, `target/gateway-api/`, and `target/alb/` under the cluster's `manifests/` dir. The renderer recursively loads these subtrees (`rglob`) and powers the `[[DL:current]]` / `[[DL:gateway-api]]` / `[[DL:alb]]` download buttons — a flat `target/*.yaml` layout will not be found.

After generating the HTML report, export manifest files for each cluster:

**Output directory:** `~/ingress_migration/<cluster>/manifests/`

```
~/ingress_migration/
├── <cluster>/
│   ├── report.md                              # Cluster markdown report

├── EKS-Ingress-Migration-<YYYY-MM-DD>-<HHMM>.html  # Combined HTML (all clusters)
└── ...
```

**Rules:**
1. `current/` — Extract each Ingress resource as YAML. Strip `status`, `managedFields`, `resourceVersion`, `uid`, `creationTimestamp`, `generation`. Keep only `apiVersion`, `kind`, `metadata.name`, `metadata.namespace`, `metadata.annotations`, `metadata.labels`, `spec`.
2. `target/gateway-api/` — Generate Gateway API manifests based on assessment findings. Number-prefix for apply order. Include comments explaining what each resource does.
3. `target/alb/` — Generate ALB Controller Ingress manifests by applying the annotation mapping from `steering/alb-migration.md`. Each file mirrors the original Ingress but with ALB annotations.
4. The `00-gateway-api-crds.yaml` file should contain only a comment with the install command — not the actual CRD content.
5. All manifests must be valid YAML that can be applied with `kubectl apply -f`.
6. **Snippet / blind-spot safety (CRITICAL):** if any source Ingress uses `configuration-snippet`/`server-snippet`/`modsecurity-snippet` (or §5.5 found snippet-injected routes), the generated target manifests are **incomplete** — they cannot represent snippet-injected `location`s (e.g. `/healthz`, deny `/internal/`). For every such Ingress you MUST:
   - **Not** generate a silently-apply-ready target; instead emit a placeholder containing a prominent header comment `# INCOMPLETE — snippet-injected routes not represented; hand-port before applying` listing the missing paths/behaviours.
   - Replace rule 7's wording for affected files with **"review & hand-port — DO NOT blind-apply"**. Blind-applying would drop health-check paths and access-control denies, breaking probes and exposing internal paths.
7. Inform the user: "Manifests exported to `~/ingress_migration/<cluster>/manifests/`. Files for snippet-free ingresses are apply-ready (`kubectl apply -f …`); files flagged **INCOMPLETE** require manual hand-porting of snippet-injected routes first."
8. **Controller-ownership pre-apply gate (CRITICAL on EKS Auto Mode):** if the cluster runs **both** EKS Auto Mode's built-in load balancing **and** a self-managed AWS LB Controller, the exported manifests MUST carry a blocking warning: *"Do NOT apply until controller ownership is reconciled."* Two reconcilers will **race** for the same AWS resources (port/target-group/IP binding locks, duplicate work, broken networking). The user must first choose **one** owner — either (a) remove the self-managed LBC and use Auto Mode managed load balancing, or (b) disable Auto Mode's load-balancing capability and let the Helm-installed LBC own everything — and scope `IngressClass`/`GatewayClass` accordingly. State this as a prerequisite step, not a footnote.

**Pass manifests directory to HTML report tool** via `--manifests` flag so the HTML can offer a download button.
